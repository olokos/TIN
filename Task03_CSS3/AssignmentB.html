            <h2>What is SSC?</h2>
            <p><b>SSC North America</b> (formerly <b>Shelby SuperCars Inc.</b>) is an American automobile manufacturer founded in 1998 by owner Jerod Shelby (no relation to car designer Carroll Shelby). The company is based in Richland, in the Tri-Cities, Washington and specializes in the production of sports cars.</p>
            <img class="imageWithinText" alt="SSC Logo" src="images/SSC%20NA%20(Minimal%201%20Inverse%20Mono).svg">
            <p>SSC claims the Tuatara has the lowest drag coefficient in its class at 0.279. The car has a carbon-fiber body construction with aluminum crumple zones and incorporates active aerodynamics.</p>
            <blockquote>The car has a carbon-fiber body construction with aluminum.</blockquote>

            <p>The interior contains leather and Alcantara upholstery and the functions of the car are controlled through a touch screen located on the center console. There is a configurable instrument panel behind the steering wheel displaying important information about the car's status along with a 300 mph speedometer. The car uses a camera system instead of traditional side-view mirrors. SSC claims that the interior can seat a 6-foot 5-inch tall person wearing a helmet.
            </p>
            <h2>Short history</h2>
            <p>SSC began working on the development of the successor of the SSC Ultimate Aero in 2011. The new car named the Tuatara was previewed in concept form at the 2011 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In August 2018, seven years after the debut of the concept, the production version of the Tuatara was shown to the general public. Designed by ex-Pininfarina designer Jason Castriota, the car takes inspiration from the aerospace industry.</p>

            <p>The car has the following driving modes: "Sport", "Track" and "Lift". In Sport mode,
            <blockquote>ride height lowers to 2.75 in (70 mm) at the front and 3.75 in (95 mm) at the rear</blockquote> the ride height is 4 in (102 mm) at the front and 4.5 in (114 mm) at the rear. In Track mode, the ride height lowers to 2.75 in (70 mm) at the front and 3.75 in (95 mm) at the rear. The Lift mode is designed to protect the underbody of the car while driving over speed bumps or driveways.
